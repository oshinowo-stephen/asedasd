> A simple little bot if I do say for myself. A bot that simply checks the clear history of the current tier and return it back to the user

## Getting started

- First add the bot into your server: [CLICK TO ADD](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=491349911279894540&scope=bot&permissions=139586947136)

- You may fetch character data that is already presented in fflogs by doing the following:
`/characters get <CHARACTER_NAME> <CHARACTER_WORLD>`
![HOW_TO_GET_CHARACTER](./images/)

- You can add your characters for easy access:
![HOW_TO_ADD_CHARACTER](./images/)
`/characters add <LOADSTONE_URL>`

- You may list your and other players' character progress:
![HOW_TO_LIST_O_CHARACTERS](./images)
`/characters list` or `/characters list <@MEMBER>`

## Why would I make such a thing?

Mainly for convenience but the idea is for those who's trying to organize groups and to see where each one of your players' is at or experineced. Aim to add utility and support with statics and raid-group or the quick party-finder experince (just incase you might get stuck in a trap party).

## Is that all?

Well if you're referring to does it only: (grab logs and display it back on discord), then yes but I do plan to add more features later on such as guides, and guild related-strats (maybe even it's own website).

## Help me?

You wanna help me? well I never would turn down a single PR, or if you got an issue you can discuss it on the issue page as-well, but if you're planning to change somethings up (way more than me at-least), join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/Kr76MBJEYv) and we can discuss it there!
